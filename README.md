# LearnVM üöÄ

**Learn Linux on Your Browser with AI-Powered Guidance**

LearnVM is an interactive browser-based learning platform that teaches Linux through real-time command execution, AI-driven assistance, and gamified progression. It provides users with a Linux terminal experience powered entirely in-browser using **CheerpX**, allowing learners to practice and master Linux skills without installing any software.

This project builds upon the work done during the [WebVM Hackathon](https://github.com/leaningtech/WebVMHackathon/blob/main/results2024.md), where a project won for its innovative use of WebAssembly and client-side virtual environments.

## üìÑ Overview

LearnVM offers a modular and interactive Linux Learning Management System (LMS) with these key components:

- **Split Workspace Interface**: One pane displays lessons/tasks, the other runs a fully functional terminal via CheerpX.
- **AI-Powered Tutor**: Learners can ask a virtual avatar questions about Linux topics, and receive smart, human-like answers powered by a generative LLM.
- **Gamified Progression**: Modules are unlocked upon completing prior tasks; users get real-time validation of their commands.
- **Prompt-Based Tutor Triggers**: Each lesson has AI prompts that help the tutor auto-respond or guide learners during errors or curiosity.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real Linux Execution** in Browser via CheerpX
- **Human Avatar Tutor** powered by Generative AI
- **Task-Based Learning Modules** with Validation
- **Interactive Prompt Engine** tied to LMS context
- **No Installation Required**

## üìö How It Works

- **Frontend**: React-based interface with module/task display and embedded terminal view.
- **CheerpX**: Provides an emulated Linux terminal directly in the browser.
- **AI Tutor**: Listens to student questions or errors and responds with guidance, using LLMs.
- **Progression System**: Tracks completion of terminal tasks and moves the user to the next challenge.

## üåü Acknowledgment

This platform builds upon previous winning solution at the [WebVM Hackathon](https://github.com/leaningtech/WebVMHackathon/blob/main/results2024.md), where client-side Linux execution with CheerpX was explored. LearnVM evolves that prototype into a complete educational tool for Linux.
